## Description
This app is a game, where users can answer questions, and guess what others vote to that question. This way they can collect points, and reach higher levels. After reaching certain levels, they can vote which questions to be asked in the game, and ask questions too.

## Frontend
- Angular
- PWA
- Ngrx store
- Angular-material
- Firebase authentication
- Google maps integration
- Fully responsive
- Optimized for slow connections
- I18N localization

## Backend
- Node.js + Typescript
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL DB 
- Winston logging
- CD to Heroku
- OpenAPI API documentation
- Schema generation based on PostgreSQL tables
- Schema generation and API validation based on OpenAPI
- Generalized error handling
- API transaction tracking with API hooks
- SSL connection to AWS RDS PostgreSQL DB
- Cron jobs ran on Heroku

## Future
I always develop this app when I have the time. These are the next features that I would like to add:

- frontend generic error handling
- add SSR
- add SEO/accessibility
- UI, integration, and unit tests (not the best practice to not do TDD, but this is just a hobby project ;)
- Language selector (i18n already working)
- time travel with ngrx
